I do not give our launcher / api it mean you will have to change the whole auth system in order to login, but it could be a test for your l2jdev, within 1 hour it should be done. (or you can reverse engin. my auth system to create your own launcher implementing the same protocol)

Aswell tenkai didnt have as plan to be retail so yep you will find non retail things.
