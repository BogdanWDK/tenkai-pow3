Welcome. Thank you for visiting the Luxury goods store. We have many precious items that you can't find anywhere else.<br>
We've recently added <font color="LEVEL">Artifacts</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Artifact Books</font> so make sure to take a look around.<br>
Do you have <font color="LEVEL">Artifact Fragments</font> by any chance? If so, you can exchange them for Artifacts with special abilities as well. Make sure to try them out.<br>
