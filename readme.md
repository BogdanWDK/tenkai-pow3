# Tenkai 

I  will maybe put public my homunculus sources soon aswell if this repo got some merge requests


### TODO: 
- Datapack isnt 100% complete
- Limited zone's packets updated but new zones arnt implemented (i let the id in the classes as commentary)
- pow2 some enchant route changed

I do not give our launcher / api it mean you will have to change the whole auth system in order to login, but it could be a test for your l2jdev, within 1 hour it should be done. (or you can reverse engin. my auth system to create your own launcher implementing the same protocol)

>Aswell tenkai didnt have as plan to be retail so yep you will find non retail

I updated from mobius free pow1 sources which mean some of their bugs are still there but i fixed some as 
- the dual class inifinite certifs
- the artifact window not implemented is now implemented and working
- agathions slots are now properly working (primary & secondary abilites) before u did have both whatever slots they were
- Some provoke skills which should only provoke mobs were also provoking players have been fixed
- much more

The pow3 packets should be 100% done but i may be have forgot something since i updated the whole thing in one night, you can imagine i didnt test everything but we didnt encounter any problems during our closed beta (2 weeks).

### Warning:

 - First point: As i said i used mobius pow1 free to start but as you can see i had fun touching the whole project and as result it became quite different than mobius which mean you probably wont be able to get their next updates.

 - Second point: i made these sources to be runnable directly from intellij idea (for dev purposes), you can run your prod server from idea its not a problem but you have to know its not optimized / made for that.

 - Third Point: i added kotlin to the srcs for some classes

>I wrote those three points to warn you: these srcs arn't easy to handle, you have to know what you're doing and have a competent team with you.
